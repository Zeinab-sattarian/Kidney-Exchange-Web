Kidney Exchange System
An interactive browser-based simulator for kidney exchange programs.
Built entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool lets you add donor–recipient pairs, configure compatibility rules, and visualize matching cycles and chains — all in a clean, responsive UI.

Features
🧍 Pair & Donor Management
Add donor–recipient pairs with:

Blood type

HLA markers

PRA %

Geographic location

Add altruistic donors to start chain matches.

🧮 Matching Algorithm
Weighted compatibility scoring:

HLA marker match → 50%

PRA level penalty → 30%

Geographic distance → 20%

Supports:

Cycles → closed loops of donations

Chains → open sequences starting with an altruistic donor

⚙ Customization
Change maximum cycle and chain length.

Filter matches by:

Pair ID

Target length

Load sample data for quick testing.
